After being frozen in time, Austin awakens in the 1990s to confront his arch-nemesis, Dr. Evil, who has also returned from his frozen slumber. With a mix of outrageous humor, memorable one-liners, and a vibrant cast, the film cleverly satirizes the spy genre while celebrating the culture of the '60s. The chemistry between Powers and Vanessa Kensington adds a romantic subplot to this zany adventure filled with groovy fashion, funky music, and over-the-top antics.

""Nosferatu"" is a seminal silent horror film that has left an indelible mark on the genre and cinematic history. The film, directed by F.W. Murnau, is an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula,"" featuring the iconic portrayal of Count Orlok, a grotesque and eerie vampire. Its innovative cinematography and atmospheric use of light and shadow create a haunting visual experience that enhances the film's unsettling themes of fear and obsession. The film is noted for its expressionist style, and Max Schreck's performance has become legendary, solidifying ""Nosferatu"" as a cornerstone of horror cinema.

## Description
Aparajito picks up where the first film leaves off, with Apu and his family having moved away from the country to live in the bustling holy city of Varanasi (then known as Benares). As Apu progresses from wide-eyed child to intellectually curious teenager, eventually studying in Kolkata, we witness his academic and moral education, as well as the growing complexity of his relationship with his mother. This tenderly expressive, often heart-wrenching film, which won three top prizes at the Venice Film Festival, including the Golden Lion, not only extends but also spiritually deepens the tale of Apu. Preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 1996.
